# AnnoyingBot
A Discord Bot that annoys and destructs the living hell out of a Discord Server. (Made with Discord.py)

The command prefix is "$" (of course without the quote marks.)

The current commands are as follows:
  $help - gives all commands out and gives a brief description of what they do
  $oof "your text here in quotes" <number of times you want that message to send> - repeats a string with a max amount of 50 times.
  $nuke - NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND UNLESS YOU HAVE EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM THE SERVER OWNER - Takes advantages of line brakes and keeps putting "nuke" in the chat over 1mil times.
  
  
# How To Use It and Install It:
1. Download/Clone this repository
2. Make a new project on Pycharm to make a venv file (or do it yourself)
3. In either python or on your code editor, run the program and wait for it to say: Bot Online and Connected.

                                                          -OR-
1. Download PreMade.zip
2. Keep al the files in the same location but extract it anywhere on your pc
3. Run the python file (all the plugins needed for this bot is in a premade venv folder so no need to make your own!)
